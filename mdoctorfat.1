.SH Description
.PP
The \fR\&\f(CWmdoctorfat\fR command was initially intended as a
test/debugging tool. It allows to flag FAT clusters as bad blocks, and
also to change the clusters allocated to a file. No consistency check
is done, clusters previously allocated to the file are not freed. Use
at your own risk.
.PP
Syntax:
.PP
.ft I
.nf
\&\fR\&\f(CWmdoctorfat\fR [\fR\&\f(CW-o\fR \fIoffset\fR] \fR\&\f(CW-b\fR \fIdrive\fR \fIclusters\fR
\&\fR\&\f(CWmdoctorfat\fR [\fR\&\f(CW-o\fR \fIoffset\fR] [\fR\&\f(CW-s\fR \fIsize\fR] \fIfile\fR \fIclusters\fR
.fi
.ft R
 
.PP
If flag \fR\&\f(CW-b\fR is present, the command marks the clusters as bad blocks
rather than change the allocation of a file.
.PP
If flag \fR\&\f(CW-b\fR is not present, the commands sets the clusters to
allocated to the file.
.PP
If option \fR\&\f(CW-s\fR is given in addition to the \fR\&\f(CW-b\fR, this also
changes the size in bytes of the file.
.PP
The cluster list is represented as a sequence of clusters or cluster
ranges. Example: \fR\&\f(CW7-10 20 21-24\fR. Each range needs to be a
different parameter.
.PP
If \fR\&\f(CW-o\fR is given, this specifies an offset to be added to each
cluster (offset is expressed in number of clusters).

.SH Viewing\ the\ texi\ doc
This manpage has been automatically generated from mtools's texinfo
documentation. However, this process is only approximative, and some
items, such as crossreferences, footnotes and indices are lost in this
translation process.  Indeed, these items have no appropriate
representation in the manpage format.  Moreover, not all information has
been translated into the manpage version.  Thus I strongly advise you to
use the original texinfo doc.  See the end of this manpage for
instructions how to view the texinfo doc.

The texinfo doc looks most pretty when printed or as html.  Indeed, in
the info version certain examples are difficult to read due to the
quoting conventions used in info.
