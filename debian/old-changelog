mtools 2.0.7 -- Kitted up by Bill Mitchell <mitchell.mdd.comm.mot.com>

  * 1. Received Ian Murdock's mtools-2.0.5 sources already modified for debian
    I note that I've seen sources on prep.ai.mit for mtools 2.0.7
    We seem to be on a branch from the main mtools code

  * 2. Added #include "string.h" to devices.c

  * 3. Added mtools.ref

  * 4. Retrieved mtools-2.0.7 from prep.ai.mit.edu

  * 5. Reconciled [1] and [4], merging the linux+debian changes for 2.0.5
    into the mtools-2.0.7 distribution.

  * 6. Modified Makefile "install:" target per debian packaging guidelines.

  * 7. Added debian.rules

  * 8. Added debian.control

  * 9. Added debian.postinst

  * 10. Added debian.postrm

  * 11. Added debian.conffiles

Changes for debian mtools-2.0.7-1 distribution

  * Renamed README.debian to debian.README
  * Renamed COPYRIGHT.debian to debian.COPYRIGHT
  * Added debian.control
  * Added debian.rules
  * Added debian.conffiles
  * Added debian.postinst
  * Added debian.rules

Changes for debian mtools-2.0.7-2 distribution

  * Corrected permissions on man pages from 640 to 644

  * Renamed man page files to have all lowercase filenames
    (e.g., mtools.1, not Mtools.1)

Changes for debian mtools-2.0.7-3 distribution

  * For the debian.rules target build:
    pass CFLAGS and LDFLAGS to Makefile

Changes for debian mtools-2.0.7-4 distribution

  * Modified debian.rules to use debian.rules.inc

Changes for debian mtools-2.0.7-5 distribution

  * In msdos.h, #define cfg_file "/etc/mtools.ref", not "/etc/mtools"
    This to enable debian.rules.inc and "make -f debian.rules binary"
    to handle the mtools.ref file more easily (the config file name
    does not change from the name under which it was distributed, and
    it does not conflict with the "mtools" executable name).  This
    was added inside a #ifdef DEBIAN conditional block.
